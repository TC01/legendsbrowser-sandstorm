Legends Browser is a legends viewer for Dwarf Fortress worlds.

[Dwarf Fortress](http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/) is both a game and fantasy world generator,
and creates astonishingly detailed fantasy settings, with a unique procedurally generated
geography and history every time it is ran. The history can be viewed from inside Dwarf Fortress
by loading a world into "Legends Mode", but if you want to view your world's history while
playing the game simultaneously, or using a nicer interface, third-party legends viewers
can be very useful. From inside Dwarf Fortress, you can dump a world's legends information
into an XML format that various tools, like this one, can read.

[Legends Browser](https://github.com/robertjanetzko/LegendsBrowser) is an open-source application written by
Robert Janetzko. This Sandstorm app allows you to create instances of Legends Browser on
the Sandstorm platform, upload legends data to it, and then host the rendered legends
of your worlds online for ease of access.

Please note: you may need a lot of RAM for Legends Browser to work, especially for large
worlds with long histories.
